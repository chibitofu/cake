## Know when a team is having a meeting.
## 30min blocks past 9am.
## Stored in tuples (start_time, end_time).
## ex (2, 3) meeting from 10:00am - 10:30am.
## Write a function merge_ranges() that takes a list of multiple meeting time ranges and returns a list of condensed ranges.

meeting_times = [(0, 1), (3, 5), (4, 8), (10, 12), (9, 10)]
