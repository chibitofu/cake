/* 
Your company built an in-house calendar tool called HiCal.
You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when everyone is available.
To do this, you’ll need to know when any team is having a meeting.
In HiCal, a meeting is stored as objects ↴ with integer properties startTime and endTime.
These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.
